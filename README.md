## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Sass preprocessor
- SVG sprite

### What I learned

My goal was to recall the knowledge gained so far from the previous course on the frontend. I.e. coding a responsive version for different devices, organizing CSS using the Sass preprocessor and rendering SVG icons using the sprite technique.
